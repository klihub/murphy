 *
 * @brief Murphy hash table implementation.
 *
 * Murphy hash tables provide a simple, general hash table implementation.
 * The API provides the usual functions for creating, destroying, and
 * resetting hash tables. It provides functions for adding entries, deleting
 * entries and looking up entries to and from hash tables. Additionally,
 * macros and functions are provided for iterating through all entries in a
 * hash table.
 *
 * One potentially interesting feature of Murphy hash tables is the optional
 * cookie support. You can think of hash table cookies as hints to speed up
 * insertion, lookup, deletion and replacement operations of hash table
 * entries. In the best case, the achievable efficiency is O(1). Cookies can
 * be viewed as virtual- or pseudo-indices into the hash table. When cookies
 * are used properly, the hash table effectively becomes a table which is both
 * indexable by hash keys and by pseudo-indices, IOW cookies.
 *
 * The easiest way to use cookies is to let the table allocate cookies for
 * you. However, if you prefer to do so you can provide cookies for the table
 * yourself. If you chose to do so, some case must be taken to properly select
 * cookies such, that the table is able to utilize them to speed up access.
 *
 * Generally speaking, to make sure cookies do achieve O(1) access times, you
 * either need to let the table allocate cookies for you, or you need to
 * declare how many entries the table is going to have at max and use as
 * cookies unique integers between 1 and the maximum number of table entries.

 * internally by the hash table. Once the hash table operation has returned,
 * you can use the @MRP_HASH_VAL which will evaluate to the calculated hash
 * value. Here's a simple example of you to use these macros:

 * uint32_t    hash;

 *     fail("hash-table lookup failed for key '%s'", key);

 * hash = MRP_HASH_VAL(h);
 *
 * Note that the macro internally uses the lowest bit of _key to mark it as
 * as a dual-use pointer for passing in the real key and retrieveing the hash
 * value. In practice this means that you cannot use this macro if your keys
 * can have their lowest bit set. Normally this is not be a problem, though.
 * If your keys are pointers (eg. strings), they will be aligned to 4, 8, or
 * 16 bytes on practically all modern platforms. If your keys are integers,
 * you probably use them as such as hash keys (IOW you set up the hash table
 * with mrp_direct_hash as the hash function), in which you don't need to
 * retrieve the hash value for a key as you already know it.
 *
 * Keep this in mind however and make sure your keys don't have their lowest
 * bit set if you intend to use this method of hash retrieval.
